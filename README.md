# School Performance Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of academic performance across multiple schools, exploring various factors such as school size, type, spending per student, and grade-level performance. The dataset encompasses a range of metrics, including average math and reading scores, passing rates, and overall performance.

## Key Insights

### School Performance Based on Size

- Small-sized schools (<1000 students) demonstrate consistently higher academic performance, with superior average scores and passing rates.
- Medium-sized schools (1000-2000 students) maintain competitive performance across various metrics.
- Large-sized schools (2000-5000 students) face challenges, exhibiting lower average scores and passing rates.

### School Performance Based on Type

- Charter schools consistently outperform district schools in average math and reading scores and passing rates.
- Charter schools show higher overall passing rates, suggesting a positive correlation between charter status and academic success.

### School Performance Based on Spending Per Student

- Schools with lower spending per student (<$585) achieve higher academic performance.
- Higher spending per student correlates with lower average scores and passing rates, indicating potential inefficiencies in resource allocation.

### Top and Bottom Performing Schools

- Cabrera High School and Thomas High School consistently rank among the top-performing schools.
- Rodriguez High School and Huang High School consistently rank among the bottom-performing schools.

### Grade-Level Performance

- Variations in average math and reading scores are observed across different grade levels, warranting further analysis to identify specific trends.

### School Type and Size Impact

- The combination of school type (charter or district) and size significantly influences academic performance.
- Charter schools, particularly smaller ones, outshine larger district schools.

## Conclusions

The analysis highlights the importance of school size, type, and spending per student in determining academic success. Smaller charter schools tend to excel, while larger district schools face challenges. Efficient resource allocation and a focus on specific factors contribute to overall improved performance.
